## Technical Requirements

### Data Structure (Local Storage)
```json
{
  "tables": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Risk Register",
      "description": "Company-wide risk assessment",
      "template": "risk",
      "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-01-02T00:00:00Z",
      "columns": [...],
      "rows": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Mock Data
- [ ] 3-5 pre-populated sample tables
- [ ] Realistic data for demonstration
- [ ] Multiple template types represented
- [ ] Various data types in columns

### Browser Support
- [ ] Chrome/Edge/Safari (latest 2 versions)
- [ ] Firefox (latest version)
- [ ] Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Definition of Done (Per Focus Area)
- [ ] Feature implemented and working
- [ ] Responsive design tested
- [ ] Data persists in local storage
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] User feedback for all actions

1. **Visual Impact** - Looks like a professional, production-ready application
2. **Functional Completeness** - All core workflows work end-to-end
3. **User Experience** - Intuitive, delightful, and efficient to use
4. **Technical Foundation** - Clean code that can evolve into production app
